# The Nerded 7D2D

```
**1)** Download `Mod Manager`

**2)** Place it into your `Mods` folder, if you don't have one create it.

**3)** Click `NERDED SERVER MANAGER` on the main menu of the game.

**4)** Now click `Download Latest Mods`.

**5)** Place contents into your `Mods` folder to make sure its updated.```

# Future Updates
